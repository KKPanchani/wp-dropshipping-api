WooCommerce Dropshipping API Plugin

This plugin integrates WooCommerce with a third-party supplier for dropshipping. When a customer creates an order, the plugin automatically sends the order details to the supplier. 

The details sent include:
Product name
Quantity
Customer name
Shipping address
Shipping method
Customer phone number

Key Features:

Automatic Order Data Transfer: When an order is placed, the plugin sends relevant order details (product name, quantity, customer info, etc.) to the third-party supplier via the API.

Order Status Tracking: Upon activation, a new column is added to the order table in the admin dashboard. This column allows the admin to view the order status, including:
  Whether the order has been shipped from third party supplier or not.
  Tracking number details (if available)

This functionality helps streamline the dropshipping process and provides transparency into the order status for store admins.
